## Overview
The query used in the [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB) scan operation performs a [cross-partition query](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/how-to-query-container#cross-partition-query). In Cosmos DB, when you run a cross-partition query on a container, you are effectively running one query per physical partition. As the partitions increase, both the latency and RUs consumed increase significantly. Cosmos DB SDKs can be tuned to [parallelize cross-partition queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/how-to-query-container#parallel-cross-partition-query) to improve the latency, but the RU charges will remain high. The following table compares the latencies for parallel and serial query execution and the effect of physical partition on latency. 

   |  Machine   |  RPS  | Threads |Container throughput| Physical Partitions|Data Size| Latency P99 MS  (Serial) | Latency P99 MS (Parallel)| Latency Avg MS  (Serial) | Latency Avg MS (Parallel)|

Having a limited number of cross-partition queries is unavoidable in some data models but as a best practice itâ€™s highly recommended to design data models to avoid cross-partition queries, especially for large containers. Additionally, make sure the partition key adheres to the [partition key selection best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#choose-partitionkey) for optimal results.

Considering the above factors, recipes for scan operation are not provided.
